// TODO: What do you think about boost?
// Initially were for prototyping new features that are candidates for std
// The direction is now more of a "is useful library", Thread library started in boost. License is really permissive.
// Now we have the https://bemanproject.org/ for prototyping
// The quality of the code is still good

// TODO: I feel strange that i have to implement it it by myslef, is there nothing from the c++ standart library we can use? 
// Draft a proposal to add this to C++, how come such a basic thing is not part of C++ yet?
// Library Evolution group LEWG(do we want to add it to C++) -> LWG(how do we add it?, is the wording right)
// Approval from evolution group
// Get expert in C++ proposal wording
// Official proposal guideline  https://isocpp.org/std/submit-a-proposal
//   probably don't need to float the idea, because it been on the internet for a while
//   Technical Specifications is the precise library wording, it doesn't need to be in the initial proposal
